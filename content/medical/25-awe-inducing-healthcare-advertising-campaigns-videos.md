![healthcare-commercial-examples-1](/assets/images/medical-advert-1.jpg "healthcare-commercial-examples-1")**What’s great about it:** Instead of the usual advice “Masks are good for your safety”, One Medical took a different approach to raise the importance of wearing masks against Covid-19. This depicts a “seemingly menacing” lumberjack chasing the “seemingly normal” person. The plot twist is that the lumberjack was the one who was running _from_ the normal person. It is a brilliant idea that conveys even the scariest people are afraid of the unintentional harm a person without a mask can cause.

Taking it to the streets, with larger-than-life murals of patients rallying their loved ones to join at fundthefight.ca. As donors provided funds, their digital flags were proudly planted on a virtual map of the city.

The Children's team knows this well: a healthy child can be energetic, unruly, and sometimes a little bratty. The first indicator that your kid is feeling under the weather is often when she or he becomes much quieter and calmer than usual.

The centerpiece of the campaign is a long-form film that tells the story of one such little brat and echoes the little girl’s unapologetically wild and mischievous nature.

**The video:**

{{< vimeo 477177912>}}

The TV commercials often show the usual suspects: Doctors, nurses, and patients all inside the hospital. This ad took a different route: Since Baylor Scott & White Health is focused on making people better so they can live a better life, they set out to create advertising that feels, looks, and sounds better, too.

The commercial depicts Baylor Scott & White Health’s better solution for invasive heart surgery. Jay is now back on his feet and feeling so much better.

The hospital nurse is then shown, bringing a warm, inviting, and much needed comforting presence. She places a paper crown on the young girl’s head and they embrace each other.

Aptly named Friday [Health Plans applies this concept](https://www.insurancily.com/ancillary-health-insurance/) to health insurance. The low-cost, hassle-free provider covers younger consumers’ basic health needs — such as annual check-ups and emergency services — so they can experience that #FridayFeeling all week long.

The video:
