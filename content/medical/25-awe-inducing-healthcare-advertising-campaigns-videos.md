Today’s advertising is not the “pale, 20% off, on sale now” kind of cringefest you’re used to encountering.

Ads now are empowered by meaningful [branding](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/) that inspires, entertain, and build a cult-like following to your healthcare brand.

In this article, I’ll share with you 25 mesmerizing healthcare [advertising campaigns](https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-marketing/). I’ll also explain why these campaigns are great and worth taking notes from.

In addition, I’ll reference what is the **brand voice** used in said campaigns.

**Brand voice** is the tone and language used when communicating your brand’s message, ads, marketing, website copy, or when talking with your patient.

These ads we will discuss today are:

1. Hospital adverts examples
2. Insurance ad campaign examples
3. Health product advertisement examples
4. Pharma ads examples
5. Other Medical adverts

Let’s start.

## Hospital adverts examples

### 1) The Plunge by One Medical

![healthcare-commercial-examples-1](/assets/images/medical-advert-1.webp "
healthcare-commercial-examples-1") **What’s great about it:** The ad taps into the collective experience of the pandemic, reminding viewers of the profound impact it had on their lives. By acknowledging the changes people have gone through, it evokes an emotional response and establishes a connection with the audience. 

By posing the question, "Who will you be after the pandemic?" the ad prompts viewers to reflect on their post-pandemic aspirations. It positions One Medical as a partner in their journey towards a better future, implying that the hospital understands the transformative effect of the pandemic and is there to provide support and care.

### 2) “Redefining Possible” by UCSF Medical Center

![healthcare-commercial-examples-2](/assets/images/medical-advert-2.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-2")**What’s great about it:** Unlike other medical centers, UCSF didn’t take the approach of “best quality care” claim. They provide quality care, but it’s not their mission. Their mission is to redefine what’s possible and take on harder challenges. This bold statement solidifies its unique position in healthcare as **a daring health institution**.

### 3) “Life-defining moments” by Getinge

![healthcare-commercial-examples-3](/assets/images/medical-advert-3.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-3")

**What’s great about it:** In the conservative MedTech industry, not many attempts to challenge the traditional norms of communication. But in their new campaign, highlighting groundbreaking ventilator technology. In this campaign, we follow a neonatologist delivering a baby at a hospital.

In a series of clips, going backward in time, we see the doctor as she gets younger. We hear her gasping for breath while exercising, cheering for joy at her graduation, and breathing nervously as she awaits her wedding ceremony.

### 4) “SickKids goes All In” by SickKids Hospital for Sick Children

![healthcare-commercial-examples-4](/assets/images/medical-advert-4.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-4")

**What’s great about it**: Each year, hundreds of charities go head-to-head to attract donations. SickKids needed to unite the city to get behind their cause. Building on their past success, they have to strike while the iron is hot.

Toronto is called the city of neighborhoods. To succeed, they need to unite them all behind the new hospital and for that, they rallied every single neighborhood in Toronto to take up arms in the fight for a new hospital. They answered the call.

Taking it to the streets, with larger-than-life murals of patients rallying their loved ones to join at fundthefight.ca. As donors provided funds, their digital flags were proudly planted on a virtual map of the city.

### 5) “Long Live Little Brats” by the Montreal Children’s Hospital

![healthcare-commercial-examples-5](/assets/images/medical-advert-5.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-5")

**What’s great about it**: As the province is a very competitive market for children’s charities, the difficult task was to break through the volume and attract donors.

The Children's team knows this well: a healthy child can be energetic, unruly, and sometimes a little bratty. The first indicator that your kid is feeling under the weather is often when she or he becomes much quieter and calmer than usual.

The centerpiece of the campaign is a long-form film that tells the story of one such little brat and echoes the little girl’s unapologetically wild and mischievous nature.

**The video:**

### 6) “So Much Better” by Baylor Scott & White Health

![healthcare-commercial-examples-6](/assets/images/medical-advert-6.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-6")

**What’s great about it:** The challenge most healthcare advertising faces is that all ads look like other healthcare advertising. The TV commercials often show the usual suspects: Doctors, nurses, and patients all inside the hospital. This ad took a different route: Since Baylor Scott & White Health is focused on making people better so they can live a better life, they set out to create advertising that feels, looks, and sounds better, too.

The commercial depicts Baylor Scott & White Health’s better solution for invasive heart surgery. Jay is now back on his feet and feeling so much better.

### 7) “Care Bravely” by Lifebridge health

![healthcare-commercial-examples-4](/assets/images/medical-advert-7.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-4")

**What’s great about it:** This ad features a young girl seen walking through a dark and menacing forest, throughout the film’s dark backdrop, she narrates her reality that for her “monsters” do exist.

During her walk, she suddenly pauses when she discovers a golden crown shining brightly amongst the tree branches. As her backdrop fades away, it is revealed that she’s a young cancer patient inside a LifeBridge Health Hospital.

The hospital nurse is then shown, bringing a warm, inviting, and much needed comforting presence. She places a paper crown on the young girl’s head and they embrace each other.

### 8) “Unstoppable” by Brookdale Hospital

![healthcare-commercial-examples-8](/assets/images/medical-advert-8.webp "healthcare-commercial-examples-8")

**What’s great about it:** The Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center is a nonprofit medical services provider working on the frontline against Covid-19 in Brooklyn, New York.

The doctors and nurses who work there are fighting a daily battle on the frontline to save people’s lives whilst putting their own at risk. So they embarked on a 60s script that would honor their sacrifice and hard work, epitomizing their tenacity.

### 11) “The Joy of Movement” by Voltaren

![healthcare commercial examples 11](/assets/images/medical-advert-11.webp "healthcare commercial examples 11")  
**What’s great about it:** Voltran is an over-the-counter drug used to treat pains such as joints, back pain, and knee pain. The ad illustrates how prolonged sitting can hinder your lifestyle and prevent you from moving freely.

**What’s great about it:** It’s a fact of life that most people will find their mental health challenged at some point. Although perfectly normal, it feels like anything but. Here, Bupa looks to challenge everyone’s perception of what’s considered to be normal and, in doing so, aims to normalize seeking support for mental health.

As a leading healthcare provider, for over 70 years, they’ve helped and supported people through life experiences as varied as people themselves. So whatever’s on your mind, it’s normal to Bupa.

### 16) “Benefits You Want” by Friday Health Plans

![healthcare insurance commercial examples 16](/assets/images/medical-advert-16.webp "healthcare insurance commercial examples 16")

**What’s great about it**: After a long, draining week, many people see Friday as an oasis from the stress of work and responsibility, and they celebrate the day with the hashtag #FridayFeeling.

Aptly named Friday [Health Plans applies this concept](https://www.insurancily.com/ancillary-health-insurance/) to health insurance. The low-cost, hassle-free provider covers younger consumers’ basic health needs — such as annual check-ups and emergency services — so they can experience that #FridayFeeling all week long.

Their advertising campaign relays this sense of freedom, beginning with the logo that hints at a cocktail glass complete with garnish.

This ad presents them as more approachable than typical Health Plans.

## Health Product Advertisement Examples

### 24) “I'm Ada, I Can Help” by Ada Health

![Health product advertisement examples 18](/assets/images/medical-advert-18.webp "Health product advertisement examples 18")

**What’s great about it:** Lack of access. Misdiagnosis. Longer waiting times and shorter visits with your doctor are all signs of a system at breaking point. Access to health information online has never been higher. Yet, our confidence and trust in this information, never lower.

What if technology could help solve these problems? This ad shows how we can help doctors accelerate diagnosis. The campaign depicts Ada, an irreverent healthcare software that placed the ability to assess your medical symptoms in the palm of your hand.

### 19) “Vagina promises” by Ria hygiene products

![Health product advertisement examples 19](/assets/images/medical-advert-19.webp "Health product advertisement examples 19")

**What’s great about it:** The Czech brand of feminine hygiene products Ria has been fighting against feminine taboos for many years. Its latest campaign, Vagina Promises, was made to address the fact that studies show that young women are not familiar with their genitals, and are often even ashamed of them.

Almost half of all Czech women don’t visit the OBGYN, although regular visits are covered by general insurance in the Czech Republic. Vagina Promises encourages young women to accept their bodies, love them the way they are, and take better care of themselves.

### 20) “Made For Greatness” by Colgate

![Health product advertisement examples 20](/assets/images/medical-advert-20.webp "Health product advertisement examples 20")

**What’s great about it:** How do you target the high-achievers audience and best performing personnel? Well, certainly not by a C-suit board office scene. The great thing about this ad is that it hints at people who aim high by depicting a climber reaching for the top summit. The tagline “Made For Greatness” will further resonate with Colgate’s customers and create cult-like loyalty to their brand.

## Medical adverts Examples

### 21) “I Happen to Like New York” by the United Way Organization

![healthcare commercials examples 21](/assets/images/medical-advert-21.webp "healthcare commercials examples 21")

**What’s great about it:** There have been many heartwarming stories to come out of the COVID-19 crisis in New York, but perhaps none as emotionally resonant as the nightly salute to the front-line workers who put their life on the line every day.

Each evening at 7 p.m. New Yorkers gather on streets (at a safe distance, of course) or lean out of their windows, banging saucepans, clapping, cheering, and hollering as exhausted healthcare workers make their way home after a shift.

### **22)** “**Brave” by OTB Foundation**

![healthcare commercials examples 22](/assets/images/medical-advert-22.webp "healthcare commercials examples 22")

**What’s great about it:** During the Covid, OTB Foundation actioned multiple initiatives aimed at supporting smaller and lesser-known hospitals in different Italian towns.

These initiatives include donations of protective equipment, distribution of masks, supplying cutting-edge technological equipment to prevent the spread of the virus, converting existing hospital wards into dedicated Covid sections, donating sanitizers and disinfection systems for ambulances, distributing respiratory helmets, face masks, and tablets.

### 23) “No Going Back To Normal” by Unison

![healthcare commercials examples 23](/assets/images/medical-advert-23.webp "healthcare commercials examples 23")  
**What’s great about it:** The core of this campaign is that while some people are desperate to get back to normal, for many, this means returning to long hours of work, low pay, and high-stress levels.

Thanks to a decade of public spending, sectors like healthcare, local government, and education are desperately underfunded. ‘No Going Back To Normal’ provides a battle cry for members of the public to sign UNISON’s open letter to demand help for workers and the rebuilding of public services.

### 25) “This Is Not A Story” by UNOCHA

![](/assets/images/medical-advert-25.webp)**What’s great about it:** Humanitarians provide medical care and life-saving services to those caught in crises. These courageous people fight famine and flood, displacement and disease, war, and injustice.

The centerpiece of the ‘Real Life Heroes’ campaign is a film featuring real humanitarians from around the globe that celebrates their truly heroic feats. To dive deeper into the stories of individuals, they collaborated with an award-winning local independent comic publisher to illustrate the experiences of real humanitarians in comic art.
