<section  id="Intro"> <div class="hook"><p>It’s terrifying research. </p><p>According to recent study by deloitte, 50% of the current hospital systems will not exist in the next 10 years. Meaning, mediocre hospitals are to drop like flies in the following decade.</p> <hr> </div> <p>You see, that’s not surprising in the slightest.</p> <!--more-->

<p>When the number of choices patients face keep growing; when your staff takes refuge in functional silos instead of a collaborative ecosystem; when you face the jagged transition to value-based care; when the market dynamics changes before you adapt; when patient retention dwindles down; Or when your hospital is swimming in a sameness-sea of “me too” hospitals, it’s no surprise half of the current health systems will vanish.</p>

<p>So, how will you cut through these hurdles?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: Implement a hospital branding strategy.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that? </p>

<h2>First, what hospital brand is not?</h2> <p> Let’s first define what brand and <a target="_blank" href="https://unnus.com/medical/healthcare-branding/">branding</a> are not so we can leave room for the truth. </p>

<p>A brand is not your hospital logo, it’s not visual designs or ads. It’s not marketing effort, collateral, or business graphics and it is not a product.<p>
<p>
Some people say a “brand is a promise” there’s some truth in that, but that’s not what it is.
</p>
</section>
<section id="Whathospitalbrandisnot">

<h2>So, what <em>is</em> a hospital brand?</h2>
<p>
A hospital brand is your customer GUT FEELING about your [healthcare organization](https://www.insurancily.com/life-insurance-tips/) or care services.</p>
<p>By customers I mean, patients, patients' families, and visitors referring physicians, doctors' offices, blood donors, staff, and third-party payers.</p>
<p>
It's a GUT FEELING because people are emotional, intuitive beings.
</p>

<p>

And because we make decisions according to our trust in the care service.

</p>
<p>

The gut feeling your customers has about your hospital is a direct result of the following:

</p>
<ul>
<li>The perception they hold about your hospital <em>in relation to your competitors</em></li>
<li>What makes you different, RADICALLY different.</li>
<li>The end-to-end experiences they have with your hospital.</li>  
<li>The communications they receive from your brand.</li>
<li>The reputation and trust you build during a period of time; And</li>
<li>The culture you create inside your organization.</li>
</ul>

<p> Is your hospital reliable or luxurious? industry-leading or Innovative?</p>

<p>Or does your hospital stand for something unique? If it does, are you vocal about it?
</p>
</section>
<section id="Whatisahospitalbrandingstrategy">
<h2>What is a hospital brand strategy?</h2>
<p>A hospital branding strategy is the management of the components that make your hospital unique.</p>
<p>

Meaning, it’s about creating perceptions and fostering organization culture.

</p>

<p>

And It’s about deciding on a communication strategy, building trust, and differentiating your hospital from the lookalike brands.

</p>

<p>Branding your hospital is about bringing clarity and painting a vivid picture for the future. </p>

<p>
It’s like developing a vaccine against:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpredictable future challenges</li>
<li>Uncollaborative hospital environment</li>
<li>Market clutter and cutthroat competition</li>
<li>Financial pressure; And</li>
<li>Unsavory reputation</li>
</ul>

<section id="Perksofhavinganestablishedhospitalbrand">

<h2>Perks of having an established hospital brand </h2>

<p>

There are immeasurable advantages to having a concrete brand in place.

</p>

<p>

I’ll name a few for the sake of brevity.

</p>
<h3>I) Branding your hospital renders your competition irrelevant
</h3>
<p>

Our brains are wired to notice what’s different. That’s because we need to maintain our sanity.

</p>

<p>

Would-be patients encounter between <a href="https://ppcprotect.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/"> 6,000 to 10,000 ads</a> every single day.

</p>

<p>

And for our brain to “filter out the clutter”, we skip past “look alikes” to pay attention to what’s unique.

</p>

<p>

Which means you’ll no longer need to compete on price, acquisitions, or volume.

</p>

<p>You are at the center of the stage.</p>
<h3>II) Branding creates cult-like loyalty to your hospital</h3>

{{% blockquote "Simon Sinek" %}}People don't buy what you do; they buy **why** you do it. {{% /blockquote %}}
<p>

You want loyal patients and to spark up their retention? Or Attract more of your ideal audience? State why you do what you do.
</p>

<p>

Why are you in the business? Why would anyone care?
</p>
<p>
That's why your hospital brand needs to stand for something.
</p>
<p>Standing for a philosophy or a principle is what we value as humans.
</p>
<p>That's because people, by nature, seek meaning.</p>

<p>
Having a unique principle that your hospital fights for, gives it that <b>substantial flair</b>.
</p>
<p>Thus attracting loyal patients that carry the same values.</p>

<p>If what your hospital stands for speaks to me on a deeper level, I’ll join your tribe. Not only that, I’ll convert more people to fight for your cause.</p>

<h3>III) Branding your hospital is beneficial to an M&A transactions </h3>
<p>Due to their large contribution to shareholder value, brands have a significant role in most M&A transactions.
</p>
<p>And to maximize the proceeds from such transactions, buyers and sellers look at the value of the brand assets. </p>

<p>That’s because they want to see whether or not the brand can benefit from their position.
</p>
<p>For example, acquirers, their goal is defined by the extent to which it can retain customers from their target firms.</p>
<p>The best predictor of retention ties back to customer satisfaction (which is what branding aims to do). </p>

<p>Whether your company is an acquirer or target firm in a potential M&A deal, having an established brand to your hospital is vital in the pursuit of growth and ROI. </p>
<h3>IV) A brand culture skyrockets operational efficiency</h3>
<blockquote>

<p>
Brand culture is the culture that a company cultivates in order to powerfully and consistently deliver its brand to the market. It's how people work together to bring the brand alive for customers.
<p><cite>—Mark Di Somma</cite>
</blockquote>

{{% ad-unit %}} {{% /ad-unit %}}


<p>Medical businesses routinely separate functions or hierarchical levels to achieve efficiencies, However...</p>
<p>These divides lead to confusion, anxiety, and distrust.</p>

<p>And that’s because employees work at cross-purposes, taking refuge in functional silos instead of a collaborative ecosystem.
</p>

<p>This makes your medical staff sub-optimizing when you need all parts working together.
</p>
<p>
To combat that, having a brand culture in place creates a sense of order, making everyone vibrate at the same wavelength.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, fostering engagement with your patients, staff and increasing commitment from stakeholders.

</p>
<p>
Doing this will lead to a culture of resilience across your organization.
</p>

<p><em><b>The Bottom line: the result of having a brand culture is coherence; the result of aimless workflow is wasted resources.
</b></em></p>

<h2>Case in point: Healthier, The risk-free hospital</h2>

<p>

<a target="_blank" href="/case-studies/healthier#">Healthier</a>, a community hospital, based in Orlando.

</p>

<p>

After collaborative work with the leadership team, we decided on a rebrand for Healthier.

</p>

<p>
Healthier is now positioned as <b>the safest hospital for its patients</b>.

</p>

<p>

They are laser-focus on being the risk-free choice in an age where patients dread insecure environments.

</p>

<p>

The healthier rebrand consisted of 5 Phases.

</p> <ol> <li>Brand DNA</li> <li>Brand Positioning</li> <li>Brand Persona</li> <li>Communication Framework</li> <li>Art Direction</li> </ol> <p>If you want to see the step-by-step process of how we develop each phase, check this guide in <a href="/charismatic-medical-brand/">healthcare branding.</a></p> <p> Their rebrand was not a mere “announcement”, they became it.

</p>

<p>All the touchpoints, nurses, physicians, websites, receptionist, press, advertising, social media, all together—yelled <b>safety</b>.</p>

<p>If you read their blog, they solely talk about lowering medical errors, preventing patient falls, reducing readmission rates, and leading a healthier lifestyle.
</p>

<p>In other words, they stood for a cause: <b>safer healthcare</b>.</p>

<p>If you ask patients about Healthier, the #1 thing they remember it for is how safe the hospital was.</p>

<p>And through the act of constant stress on leading a healthier life and being safe first, they are the safest option for their patients.</p>

<p>The “why” / the purpose statement they developed, acted as a decision-guide to their actions.</p>

<p>And by being specific and focusing on one thing, they achieved a higher goal, quality care.</p>

<p>They own the “safest hospital” title.</p>

<p>This happens when you maintain your “why”.</p>
<p>Not only that, You need to manage your organization’s culture day-to-day.</p>
<p>If you are not active on keeping clarity, discipline, and consistency in balance, then trust starts to break down.</p>
<p>
At the simplest level, you want your medical business to be purpose-backed
</p>
<p>
Your marketing channels, staff, and the doctor giving care, all need to be on the same page.</p>
<p>
You need everyone to be on the same page delivering a consistent patient experience </p>
<p>
The garage guy needs to say something like “I work in the parking lot of a place that’s on this <b>mission</b>”.</p>
