							<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Do I want to stop seeing 25 patients a day running room to room doing great volume? And that&rsquo;s how I make my living with very unfulfilling day after day or do I want to develop a relationship based practice where people actually come to me because they truly love you.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Welcome to the care frontier podcast The show where we interview thought leaders in health care to share with us their expert knowledge in everything business, branding, and marketing. If you&rsquo;re a practitioner, medical business owner or an executive, this is the place to be I&rsquo;m your host Sliman: Baghouri and today we&rsquo;re going to discuss how to build a brand culture of trust advantages of continuous learning and how it can transform your practice. Be sure to tune in all the way through for more details.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to the care frontiers podcast where we bring healthcare professionals to share with us their own experience running a successful medical business. I&rsquo;m really happy to have one of the leaders of the dental industry and the renowned expert in cosmetic and restorative dentistry. Today&rsquo;s guest is voted multiple times as best dentist by South Jersey magazine. He&rsquo;s an author of the protocol founder doctor and international speaker. Dr. Steven: Rasner, welcome to our show.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Thank you very much Sliman: for even having me. I&rsquo;m excited to be a part of your show.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re  really happy to have you here. So, Dr. Rasner, I really want to dive deep into something you often talk about in your own show, the lionhearted podcast, and that is about building Brand culture of trust. How do you go about sending trust signals to your patients and building this kind of relationships?</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Well, that is a very loaded question. I want to elaborate on it for a minute. Because, you know, when one of your listeners right now, maybe hearing even the term culture of trust or, or culture at all, or branding, a lot of people in my health, industry of dentistry don&rsquo;t understand they think that&rsquo;s just Fufu stuff. And it&rsquo;s not important, so much, you know, I mean, what is really important, of course, is to them, often misguided is, well, as long as I&rsquo;m a great clinical dentist, or as long as I&rsquo;m accessible, because I have tremendously convenient hours, or perhaps my fees are very, very competitive low, in fact, and that&rsquo;s what I used to build this organization to what it is.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And the truth is, that is not the best way to build a long, enduring, successful health industry based organization, in my opinion. And I will tell you something in the past, like if you go back to the 80s, and it&rsquo;s shocking that I can say that to you, because I&rsquo;ve been doing this now for 40 years, you know, one of the ways that I would market or brand is like, cosmetics, for example, before and after picture, that was a big deal for many, many years. And I can tell you, that&rsquo;s what I would focus on pictures in the media or online and these beautiful before and afters. And I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not a part of the branding of a practice, but like perhaps like on your, on your website, I certainly would be important to have a section there of what you&rsquo;re able to achieve in changing someone&rsquo;s smile. But I&rsquo;m talking about what really draws new patients. Remember, new patients are generally referred by other patients to our practices. And I will tell you, it&rsquo;s unequivocal to me and I don&rsquo;t remember the pivotal point as to when it happened. I think it happened from my own personal experiences, to understand that what patients have to feel from my practice for me to endure is trust and confidence. And if I may, let me just give you an example, in our regular lives, how that holds up. If you go to even a car mechanic and certainly dentist or not car mechanics, I get it.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>But you know, lots of us like in our lifetimes are fortunate to have a foreign car or something. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unusual for a person to be guarded when they take that car into the mechanic for an evaluation about something could we all and that invokes fear to me right now as I&rsquo;m even saying it to you and what it comes down to is I&rsquo;m always scared they&rsquo;re going to hit me for more than that&rsquo;s really needed. And I have to say to you, that is unfortunately a very good analogy in dentistry today for example, it is and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s also spreads up and other health industry factors and probably even medicine at times. And so having somebody come to you because they heard they can trust you because everything so how do you make that happen? Which was was your original question.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the answer: It happens with a total team effort. It can&rsquo;t just come from the doctor, it has to happen from every employee that you have. So how do they know what to do? You know, I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like in all branches of medicine. But I know in a lot of dental offices, it&rsquo;s really hard for a struggling practice to come to terms with, they have to put their drills down, and they have to put everything aside and me as an organization, literally meet and train to be successful, because you&rsquo;re not going to be able to convey what&rsquo;s needed from your staff. In the three minute conversation before you start a day. It doesn&rsquo;t work like that people have to discuss what does build trust. And of course, doing what you say you&rsquo;re going to do is one way of doing that. But it really needs to start as a brand through and through from even your advertising, I want to tell you sliman:, that, in my branding, when I&rsquo;m out there marketing, whether it is on radio, which I use, whether it is in media, or newspapers, or, or even on the internet, I might go to words, literally our trust and confidence. And it&rsquo;s something that my whole organization is very aware of, because I&rsquo;m always talking about how important it is that that&rsquo;s what the patient perceives, let me give you an example, in dentistry, it&rsquo;s not unusual for a new patient to come in, go through this process of whatever office policies are for that office. So they you know, they&rsquo;ve made an appointment on the phone with somebody, well, that somebody in my office can&rsquo;t be random as to be somebody that knows that feeling trust from the moment they first call us, as part of it, think about it, if you&rsquo;re rushed on the telephone, or if you&rsquo;re treated robotically by a new office, that you telephone, naturally, even that little thing doesn&rsquo;t invoke trust, you know, if you if you put on hold, if you&rsquo;re constantly interrupted whoever&rsquo;s doing this new patient intake interview.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Yeah and one of the things that is you get second impression, if you mess that up, you missed the potential lasting relationship with a potential patient.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely right. I mean, this, you know, the patient&rsquo;s never going to get to understand whatever services that I think are superior that I can offer them, if they don&rsquo;t get past the person that&rsquo;s taking this call. So this is not a random person, I have 80 employees in my organization. And there&rsquo;s only two and especially one that I would prefer to do this intake interview because she gets it, she understands what you just pointed out that we don&rsquo;t get a second chance. And by the way, this person I&rsquo;m talking about wants to be this person, and she&rsquo;s not forced into this false facade, or that I make her look like she is designed by selection of me during my years of working, that she&rsquo;s the perfect person.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And we all know people like this, that feel inviting, that feel passionate about what we do, yes, even that&rsquo;s a part of the culture of trust, that very first call, and then they come into the office. Now remember, we&rsquo;re talking about trust, can they trust this new organization that are going to try out? Well, if that&rsquo;s the case, when they walk in the office, there&rsquo;s two things that are going to happen. There&rsquo;s visual, and there&rsquo;s auditory, so visually, obviously, specially in the world of COVID today, but even when it was in the world of COVID it&rsquo;s got to be Walt Disney clean has to be immaculate and that&rsquo;s just words out of my mouth unless the guys listening designate and are comfortable to designate employees to make sure that office does look he macula you know you can&rsquo;t have people that are okay with walking by for example, a door that may have glass on it in your office that&rsquo;s got fingerprints all over it. I mean my office think about if one of the patients they walked into an office that didn&rsquo;t do that or was half into doing that or did exercised week programs to screen patients but even before that slimming I even before COVID we had an I had a eventful new patient experience you know so we have a snack bar and stuff in our waiting room. And you know, it&rsquo;s got to be immaculate that mean the trash never trash in the trash can in hell. I know it&rsquo;s called a trash can. But you know, everything has to be just wow, this place looks and and and that requires me as the boss having it painted every other year.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re visual beings. Also we have a bias toward things that are visually appealing. So it&rsquo;s like like underutilized tactic visuals that is</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>and the listeners should understand that. I haven&rsquo;t said anything about putting a waterfall in your reception room and having it at the level of a Ritz Carlton And four seasons, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of money. It doesn&rsquo;t. And you have that money, you have enough money to make it clean to make it spa like, I really think anybody listening can afford to do that. And eventually, very soon, if you&rsquo;re new in practice, we&rsquo;ll be able to afford to do that. And it is first impression, man, like you just said, and so, you know, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>right. It&rsquo;s like, Look, I went to a doctor, a new doctor for me, because regrettably, my physician died. And so for the first time, in years, I was forced to find one and I was shot, I walked in my just gut appearance. Now when I say this to you, it was based on the lighting, and just based the chair, I sat in, whatever, it was dreadful, and it looked unclean, I&rsquo;m talking about a physician&rsquo;s office, it looked unclean, there wasn&rsquo;t trash on the floor, or waste anywhere, it just didn&rsquo;t look clean, it didn&rsquo;t. And the lighting was putrid. And, and I knew as before I even met anybody, I was getting negative vibes just sitting there. So yeah, man, that I think it can really impact the mindset of the person that&rsquo;s coming in to see us.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>So the next thing would be having a front desk team understand the importance. Now we&rsquo;re talking trust, but to me, it&rsquo;s all connected, making the person that walks in and feel value, you know, picture in your head, I tap into me in my life, that you walk into a new office, maybe the person at the desk is on the phone, and doesn&rsquo;t even look up and acknowledge you. Maybe they hand you a chart, as they&rsquo;re on the phone or engaged with something else, or just a lack of a lack of an inviting smile, we&rsquo;re happy you came to see us kind of look, any of those things would never happen in any office that&rsquo;s successful. So the reason all these things you hear me talk about about having a visual positive effect when they walk in having a an effect from a team members that make the new patient feel value. I mean, if you really think about it, it&rsquo;s exactly what all of us do, when we go to choose to do business with the people that we do business, you know, so all of us has experienced, many of us have experienced walking into a new doctor&rsquo;s office with someone on the phone, that doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge you.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Or maybe they just hand you a chart, or maybe they&rsquo;re involved with somebody else, a co-employee, and they get to you, when they kind of get to you, that all just resonates that you&rsquo;re not valuable to them. And listen, you got to understand something. And those of you that have heard me speak before would already know this. But new listeners and people maybe from outside the United States would not know that. I&rsquo;m in an area of crumbling of southern New Jersey called Cumberland County. And I don&rsquo;t like saying this because I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not trying to be disrespectful to the county that I practice in for 40 years. But it is what it is. And what it is, is an incredibly economically challenge part of the United States. And the reason I&rsquo;m saying all this to you. So it&rsquo;s like those of you if you want to envision visualize this, I&rsquo;m about an hour from Philadelphia, in the United States. And you know, it&rsquo;s a totally different part of the country. But no, it&rsquo;s just one hour from one of our major cities, and it&rsquo;s riddled with people with the blue collar. Mostly blue collar workers, working people that work hard, a lot of people are unemployed for really the whole time I&rsquo;ve been down there. And not only that, I am surrounded by dental offices that prioritize insurance. I&rsquo;m a non insurance practice, okay, that is a road less traveled if you&rsquo;re a dentist.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>So people who choose to come to my office are consciously knowing that they&rsquo;ll be reimbursed less by their insurance company by choosing to come to me. So if you think I can accomplish that for many years, with just good Clinical Excellence, I can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s got to be a whole package. And I know you get this if you think about it, because it&rsquo;s exactly what you do. I mean, when you want a better fabric of something for your house, when you want better a meal, when you want a better getaway wherever you you pay for that, because it&rsquo;s worth it to you. And so part of that being worth it is feeling the value that you bring to that new company because they make you feel that and look, I have had extraordinary according to numbers success for a very, very long time in my area, the economically challenged area that I just pointed out to you and I am here to say to you that is a net result of Yes, doing work that works and that&rsquo;s a part that&rsquo;s a part of trust. To Of course, how do you stand behind the dentistry that you provide? Are you is that always the patient&rsquo;s thought? Are you always? Are you ever accountable? Do you ever give them the benefit of the doubt? Yes, when it comes to trust, how you stand by your clinical work, all comes into play very, very much as you would expect it would. And that said, it has everything to do with people feeling value. And that value starts when they walk into the office for the very, very first time, and how they feel their walk treated. And so the process continues as they come through the Office out for that very first time. And, you know, they could be recognized or past an employee of mine, who may think that their role is not significant, because let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s an employee who just sterilizes instruments, that&rsquo;s all they do in the office. Well, even that employee is trained and recognized in my office, in the value in the in the art of making people feel valuable. How do you do that? Well, of course, you do it with eye contact and a smile, or maybe Good morning. I know that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot. And listen, I got a lot of this information. I learned a lot of it from the four seasons in the Ritz Carlton Hotel chains early in my career, because I just listen, it&rsquo;s not that I wanted to make my office all fluffy. And that&rsquo;s all that matters. But they have a long history of amazing success with what they do. And it works. And by the way, even, it&rsquo;s just a nice way to be anyway.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s normal decency.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just a nice way to go through your days each day. So I guess one of the things I&rsquo;m trying to say to you in a very, very long way, is I have trained my team through meetings. Now we have meetings monthly. And there&rsquo;s times by the way, where your office and my office need a meeting every two weeks, it depends how much of the culture you&rsquo;re trying to change.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s really interesting. So you explicitly have this kind of meeting just for the for the sake of coordinating everything and overhauling the whole experience.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Yes, you guys listening to this will never get to where they want to get to, if they think they can just cram this in a five minute talk before they start work on. Hey, I heard this interesting podcast, Alan on Care Frontiers. And no, no, you either commit or dunk committed be like trying to go and change your body shape by going to the gym one time. And it&rsquo;s not just it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s worth it, guys, you know why it&rsquo;s worth it? Because it leads in dentistry, at least to high case acceptance and high referrals think you got to think of something, how else could it be possible that I could ever practice that pound for pound probably out produces any other practice two to one, in terms of what our net production ends up being, which I don&rsquo;t really care about. But it&rsquo;s something that we use, it&rsquo;s like saying you don&rsquo;t care about the score? I mean, yes, at some point, what am I office produce? Is it profitable? Is it enjoyable? Is it pleasurable, and it&rsquo;s all those things, when you work towards this type of culture, when the culture is, you know, warm, inviting, trusting, valuing people, and then it just doesn&rsquo;t come unless you train, and you know, body language well, but when I say body language, for example, I mean, just eye contact, smile, hiring people that like people, I mean, not every body you hired, even cares about they, some people would hear this today. And think this is a bunch of BS crap, and just be a good dentist, and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other stuff. I mean, it being on time, which is the ease one of the easier things any office could do. That&rsquo;s a trust thing, you want to erode the trust of a new patient or existing patient, have them sit in your reception room for more than 15 minutes. I said, 15. That&rsquo;s the tops, I not even sure you should do that.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>What I like them to do is not even have a chance to sit down. Because I like how that feels when I go into a business. And I know my personal time clock at tops is 15 minutes. It is. And so that&rsquo;s part of trust, that&rsquo;s part of your protocol. So that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff we discuss. And you know, I&rsquo;ve been in this quite a long time. And I&rsquo;ve had quite fortunate to have most staff members with me over 20 some years, but I&rsquo;ve had some periods of my career where they changed and maybe I have a new hygienist for example. And look as recently as a couple months ago, I walk into the office. So let&rsquo;s say we start patients at nine, you know, I was coming in recently, and I I used to get to the office one hour before I started so I got all of the non productive and when I say that I mean stuff that produces money out of the way phone calls, a meeting with a certain staff member, etc etc. So that when I was ready at nine o&rsquo;clock for my first patient, whatever it is for you, then it&rsquo;s called I wrote a book called The protocol book. Many years ago now, it&rsquo;s still very, very relevant. And one of the protocols is called the ready to work protocol. And that meant you came in an hour early, you call your dental labs, you call a specialist, if you needed to you do whatever, you have to do that. So you don&rsquo;t interrupt patient care later by doing that stuff. And so when it was ready to work, and whether that&rsquo;s eight or nine o&rsquo;clock, you indeed were ready to work. And I walked in my office a few months ago, and these were established employees by me, I&rsquo;ve been talking about two people with me 20 years, a hygienist, and I noticed over a period of a couple of weeks that they would be at the front desk like at 9:05, 9:09, winner nine o&rsquo;clock patients were in a waiting room. And I I love my staff, I&rsquo;m pretty fortunate. I was furious. I was on fire inside. How dare you? Like, how do you think that&rsquo;s okay? They can see you. They see you. And you&rsquo;re sitting there and they have watches on?</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that okay by anybody?</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And I used to make the excuse that, well, we&rsquo;re dentists, we&rsquo;re not psychiatrists, and you can&rsquo;t really predict what time you&rsquo;re done. But the way to do that is to always give yourself more time than you really need for any given procedure. And some of you are going to say, well, it&rsquo;s easy for you to say, you know, I need to produce or I&rsquo;m going to go broke, I have big overhead. And I do I know I have all those things, because, you know, I bought a brand new office 10 years ago for a lot a lot of money, big space. I don&rsquo;t even sure it was smart at the time. In retrospect, it was worth it to me. And so I have mortgages and stuff. I know what it means to have to produce. But here&rsquo;s what it all leads to. Here&rsquo;s the caveat, I am telling you, I am 100% positive that that patient walk that calls you that experiences somebody on the phone that seems engaged in that conversation that then walks into your office weeks later, whenever that appointment, is there a day letter and that feeling continues, right.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And remember, this person has seen my marketing, they&rsquo;ve seen that they go to a dentist that you can trust and you&rsquo;re confident if I mean, my words aren&rsquo;t exactly that, but that is the brand message on everything we talk about 100% of the time, and Okay. And then they finally get into we haven&rsquo;t even talked about this, they get into an opportunity, which is when they finally meet me. And are you. And so what happens there? Well, when I walk in that room at that point, they&rsquo;ve had x rays, they&rsquo;ve been charted, they do not feel rushed at all. And by the way, which I haven&rsquo;t said, with a new patient in my office, we probably experienced 70% of having the spouse with them. Can you imagine that? at our first visit</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>70%, you asked them for that?</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>I request them to bring the spouse Yes.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>70%. that&rsquo;s a high number.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it for years and years, I would not insult your audience by making up a number. It&rsquo;s at least 70%. And it&rsquo;s the old thing that if asked, and you will receive because I The reason that&rsquo;s a factor. And it wasn&rsquo;t a factor in 1980 when I started was because treatment plans were not as involved as they are today. Today, many dentists function in some capacity, like plastic surgeons, a lot of what you do is elective, you know, you can remove an upper right molar and the patient doesn&rsquo;t die if you don&rsquo;t replace it. But you could also replace that Moeller with an implant. Well, that could be a four to $5,000 different bottom line on just one tooth that I paid. So how many of our married couples or couples period, make those type of decisions without some input from their significant other, and you could give the presentation of a lifetime, the best one you ever did. And if you give that patient a 15k to $20,000 treatment plan, honest one, obviously, you&rsquo;re not just trying to veneer, crooked teeth that don&rsquo;t really bother them. If you get it, you&rsquo;re really going through and I forgive me, but I mean, I I&rsquo;ve been doing this for many, many tickets. I think it&rsquo;s in the best interest of our patients to do comprehensive examinations.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And the net result of all this that I&rsquo;m telling you is trust and confidence because it really then falls on the doctor when you&rsquo;re in about trust and confidence when you get to the operatory it&rsquo;s unbelievably important at that point. Because and it&rsquo;s an area trust me, that many of my colleagues struggle with because, you know, one of the courses I&rsquo;ve taught over the years is called what to do when and if you stop and think about that, and I even tell my patients at a time so then we patients that you know we&rsquo;re in that moment right now you&rsquo;ve walked into my office You&rsquo;ve been here for 30 minutes, you&rsquo;ve just met me. And it&rsquo;s my job to recommend something to you based on what I see with my eyes and based on what you have come to me for. And in the end, the end evaluator is going to be you the patient, did I provide something that worked for you did, was it worth it did it last, you know, that&rsquo;s how I exist. And so I go through a whole thing with them.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>And I go out of my way sliman:, to tell them, I am not here to sell you. I actually say that to them. I say, I just want to say something. I love what I do. And I think anybody listening to your podcast, or any podcast, because it&rsquo;s not required to keep a license to do this type of research, listen to podcasts are probably more passionate than the average guy, you guys got to remember that there&rsquo;s many dentists that wouldn&rsquo;t dream of taking time off of their lives, and listening to a podcast.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>they would take tons of time off, and play golf, or get on their boat. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. You have one life, you should live your life to how you want to enjoy it. I and many of those listening, get tremendous satisfaction, having high level success from what we do every day in our jobs. That&rsquo;s what motivates me, to be honest with you. Maybe if I was a world class tennis player, which I&rsquo;m not, I would not care as much about that. But we all like to do the things that we&rsquo;re good at. And anybody you know, what&rsquo;s interesting, is interesting is that everything I&rsquo;m telling you doesn&rsquo;t even cost money. And I didn&rsquo;t say you had to go out, if you buy these set of tapes for $10,000, or take training in my Institute, you&rsquo;ll be set to you don&rsquo;t need to do any of that. All you need to do, you do need to care enough to make a game plan and follow the game plan. The game plan is you have to train your team.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>First, you got to sit down with yourself and say how important is this? Do I want to stop seeing 25 patients a day running room to room doing great volume? And that&rsquo;s how I make my living with very unfulfilling day after day? Or do I want to develop a relationship based practice where people actually come to me because they truly love you. Because they trust you. And, and they they don&rsquo;t tend to jump dentist to dentist, like a traditional practice, you&rsquo;ll always lose people, by the way. But I mean, in general, when we look at this, and it comes from it is hard work. And and it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s heartbreaking sometimes. Because even when I do everything I just discussed in this podcast, you know, I&rsquo;ll lose people because just because of money, because that sometimes is what leads a patient&rsquo;s decision. And that&rsquo;s just what it is. It still hurts my feelings,</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t afford you, basically.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Yeah, they just can&rsquo;t. And maybe, you know, they realize, well, you know, I if I go in network Ratner&rsquo;s out of network, I won&rsquo;t cost as much, but blah, blah, blah. But you know, to summarize this building a brand of culture of trust, I can&rsquo;t think of a better culture, then to build it not around that you&rsquo;re the best implantologist in Sydney, Australia, or, you know, St. Louis, Missouri, United States. That&rsquo;s important. That&rsquo;s a wonderful skill to have and reputation to have. But I will tell you that you&rsquo;d be much more successful, unfulfilled. If you walked into an environment every Monday through whatever days you work, and we&rsquo;re surrounded because that culture is positive karma, even to you, the owner just to see the people executing people&rsquo;s skills. And by the way, for what it&rsquo;s worth, you know, the Ritz Carlton does actually give instruction on how to get your team to make people feel valued, like the Ritz Carlton does. And don&rsquo;t confuse when I say Ritz Carlton with the physical plant that I think it&rsquo;s necessary for you to have. In other words, you don&rsquo;t need to have expensive art or anything like that. Marble, granite everywhere. And I&rsquo;ve been in offices like that to have waterfalls in a waiting room. You know,</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>my office isn&rsquo;t like that at all. It&rsquo;s pretty ordinary, to be honest with you. It&rsquo;s clean, looks like a spa kind of. But it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m sure many of you listening have much more opulent offices than I have. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do have I have a fervent I have a fervent, loyal, based practice of patient I do. Why else would they pay me week after week, year after a year tremendous investment to finally remember, I&rsquo;m not the first dentist that they visited. They finally took the leap and they came to me and some of these people pay frightening amounts of money, not because I&rsquo;m ripping them off because I do do a lot of implant dentistry. And it does involve multiple procedures and time. A ton of money when they never did that before. So how did that happen? It happened because the patient decided to call in office for some reason, maybe it was a broken tooth. Maybe they looked in a picture. Or maybe maybe their significant other pointed out their smile is just not good. It did you notice your smile, honey? I mean, look at this picture, something triggered them, they got on the phone. And my first chance was whoever they picked up that number in my office did a ring four times that I have a tape machine on. The answer&rsquo;s no, everything counts. You can&rsquo;t pick the phone up. After four rings in my office, you get picked up after two rings. There&rsquo;s never a tape machine in town somewhere closed. You know, I say this to you. Because a lot of offices, when you call during the working hours will have a tape machine on say we&rsquo;re treating patients, right? A new patient doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about that. They want to live voice to get to just like you do when you have a credit card problem, etc, etc. So that&rsquo;s what I have to say about culture and trust.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Dr. Rasner for, for taking the time. And I think what seemed interesting to me is that it&rsquo;s not something that is measurable in numbers like acquisition or something like that, you really took the time to build the brand of trust for your practice. And the patients are the favoring you, even though there are multiple alternatives.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>I am the minority, I&rsquo;m literally the only office in an area of about 80,000 people. Now I&rsquo;m not in a town of 80,000 that comprises three different towns, of which make up a county. And I am the only office that is fee for service, which my dental friends now that means I&rsquo;m out of network, which means to my patients, they&rsquo;re paying more to come to us. And we have to earn that every single day. But just the way it is.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a built in a preference to your to your office.</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Well, we have choices of everything do we not? When you go to purchase a car, of course, you can get the cheapest car. And I would say to you that trust Trumps anything else a dentist could do, in fact composite above it to attract business. You if you&rsquo;re the lowest fee for all your services in town, you will not win against the practice that builds trust confidence. It makes people feel value. If your convenient open at night, I&rsquo;m not open at night. I&rsquo;m not open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Because I&rsquo;ve earned that that&rsquo;s part I was by the way, at times in my practice for many years. That&rsquo;s part of the payoff that I&rsquo;m trying to communicate to you through the podcast for doing all this. So yeah, that&rsquo;s my reward. I don&rsquo;t have to work at nights because there&rsquo;s enough demand of the people that want what we offer to stay very busy Monday through Thursday, nine to five, you know, it&rsquo;s banker hours, man, I didn&rsquo;t you know, it&rsquo;s, I it wasn&rsquo;t always like that. But it&rsquo;s been like that for a very long time. And it&rsquo;s, you know, it makes it makes the professional side of my life more enjoyable that way, and it would make yours as well. And so, yeah.</p>
<p>Sliman:</p>
<p>Dr. Rasner, do you have any takeaways that you can say to the listener, right now they can, you can take an implement right away like a something that you want drill down on or to emphasize on?</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Yeah, two takeaways would be one would be take some time. I mean, this to reflect when you&rsquo;re not in the office, don&rsquo;t do this. When you&rsquo;re in the office. Think about on a weekend. And and you this is your life, man. So think about it even more than one weekend and write stuff down? What is it you&rsquo;d really want? There was a time in your life when you decided to be a dentist, so or whatever you&rsquo;re doing. And there was something about that choice that made you want to do that? How did you envision your practice to be? Okay, if you&rsquo;re an associate right now, for another dentist, if you&rsquo;re a dental student, what is it that you&rsquo;re looking for? Now, look what I&rsquo;ve just painted for you. I mean, think about him in his 40 years now, I just told you the hours we work, not only that I get to do challenging procedures on people that appreciate and I get paid up front. I mean, that&rsquo;s, we could we could have 10 podcasts on what I have to say to you, but so there&rsquo;s a reason for that too, by the way, so we actually get paid up front for what we do. And there&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s not so I can bank your money and feel like a fat cat. That&rsquo;s not the reason it decreases broken appointments, ensures a commitment by the patient to what they lined up to do. And the alternative is not very good, trust me because I&rsquo;ve experienced it. So one day takeaway would be, look, and take the time first with yourself to say what you want to say with your your perfect vision of your practice or businesses. Do you have that or not?</p>
<p>Steven:</p>
<p>Most of you don&rsquo;t. Even I do all the time. So what does that require? It requires to me You have to meet, it won&rsquo;t be, it will never be the reason ever, that you come close to going bankrupt, or anything like that. It&rsquo;ll never destroy the worst that can happen. Here&rsquo;s what the worst that can happen is that you&rsquo;ll meet with your team. And enough people, because there&rsquo;s always going to be m staff members who will not go with change, they don&rsquo;t like change. And they won&rsquo;t, there may they may have to replace certain staff members over time. That because it&rsquo;s just would be uncanny. For me to imagine everybody has the right amount of people committed to achieve what I&rsquo;m trying to get you to achieve. So the worst that can happen is that you&rsquo;ll have to change Well, that&rsquo;s good change is good for you, you have to care more than anybody else, Doctor, because you have the most to gain and lose. I&rsquo;m telling you something, I took a practice, I never stepped foot in from 700,000 to 2.7 million. I didn&rsquo;t charge him he came up to me. And he he he taught me clinical dentistry, implant stuff over a period of about three years, two years was two years. And I told him how to grow his practice, just like I&rsquo;m talking to you right now. And this guy was 68 when I started working with him, I&rsquo;m not saying this to you to hire me as a consultant, because I don&rsquo;t even think I would, you could hire me as a consultant, you&rsquo;d have to really talk me into it. I&rsquo;m telling you because it&rsquo;s doable. On almost at a level, it absolutely is doable, but it&rsquo;s never going to happen. And the takeaway is you have to start meeting more and self analyzing, and then invoke, implement the change that we&rsquo;re talking about. Like that&rsquo;s what you have to do first, and don&rsquo;t put any hold on CE. Even if you&rsquo;re CE, a continue education I would borrow to take education if I was the listener.</p>
